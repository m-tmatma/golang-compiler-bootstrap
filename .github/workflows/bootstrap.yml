# 
# > The Go toolchain is written in Go. To build it, you need a Go compiler installed. 
# > The scripts that do the initial build of the tools look for a "go" command in $PATH, 
# > so as long as you have Go installed in your system and configured in your $PATH, 
# > you are ready to build Go from source. Or if you prefer you can set $GOROOT_BOOTSTRAP 
# > to the root of a Go installation to use to build the new Go toolchain; 
# > $GOROOT_BOOTSTRAP/bin/go should be the go command to use.
# > 
# > The minimum version of Go required depends on the target version of Go:
# > 
# > Go <= 1.4: a C toolchain.
# > 1.5 <= Go <= 1.19: a Go 1.4 compiler.
# > 1.20 <= Go <= 1.21: a Go 1.17 compiler.
# > 1.22 <= Go <= 1.23: a Go 1.20 compiler.
# > Going forward, Go version 1.N will require a Go 1.M compiler, where M is N-2 rounded down to an even number. Example: Go 1.24 and 1.25 require Go 1.22.

#
#  1. Build go1.4  by gcc
#  2. Build go1.17 by go1.4
#  3. Build go1.20 by go1.17           (with setting GOROOT_BOOTSTRAP to go1.17)
#  4. Build go1.22 or master by go1.20 (with setting GOROOT_BOOTSTRAP to go1.20)
